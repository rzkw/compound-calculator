### 🧮 Compound Interest Calculator 🧮

A simple web app to calculate compound interest written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. My second intro to DOM manipulation.

##### *How to view the calculator:*

The web app is deployed on Azure Static Web Apps and can be viewed [here](https://nice-grass-0c532b010.6.azurestaticapps.net/)!

##### *To run as a container*:

- Open Docker 
- Run the build command:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:80 rzkw/calculator
```

##### *To use the calculator:*

1. Enter your principal amount in the 'Principal Amount ($)' field
2. Enter your annual interest rate in the 'Annual Interest Rate (%)' field
3. Enter how long the principal is being saved for in the 'Time Period (years)' field
4. Select how often interest compounds from the drop down selector, press Calculate

The results will be displayed in two segments: the Future Value of the principal and the Total Interest Earned.
